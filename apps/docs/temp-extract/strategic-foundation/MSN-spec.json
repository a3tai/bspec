This should be 1-2 sentences that clearly communicate why the organization exists.*\n\n## Mission Statement\n*The formal mission statement (typically 1-3 sentences that can be memorized)*\n\n## Core Purpose\n*Detailed explanation of the organization's reason for being*\n\n### Primary Beneficiaries\n- Who we serve\n- How we create value for them\n- Why they matter to our purpose\n\n### Fundamental Value Creation\n- What value we create in the world\n- How we make things better\n- What would be lost if we didn't exist\n\n### Scope and Boundaries\n- What we do and don't do\n- Where we operate\n- Limits of our mission\n\n## Mission Evolution\n*How the mission has evolved and why*\n\n## Living the Mission\n*How the mission translates into daily operations and decisions*\n\n## Validation\n*Evidence that the mission is being fulfilled*\n```\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n### Bronze Level (Minimum Viable)\n- [ ] Clear, one-sentence mission statement exists\n- [ ] Primary beneficiaries are identified\n- [ ] Basic value creation is described\n- [ ] All required metadata fields completed\n\n### Silver Level (Investment Ready)\n- [ ] Mission statement is memorable and distinctive\n- [ ] Detailed beneficiary analysis completed\n- [ ] Value creation is quantifiable\n- [ ] Mission guides documented decisions\n- [ ] Stakeholder feedback incorporated\n\n### Gold Level (Operational Excellence)\n- [ ] Mission evolution history documented\n- [ ] Regular mission review process established\n- [ ] Mission measurement framework implemented\n- [ ] Cultural integration practices documented\n- [ ] Mission validation evidence collected\n\n## Common Pitfalls\n\n1. **Too Broad**\n   - Problem: \"Make the world better\" tells us nothing actionable\n   - Solution: Focus on specific beneficiaries and value creation\n\n2. **Too Narrow**\n   - Problem: Limiting mission to current products rather than purpose\n   - Solution: Think about fundamental purpose, not current solutions\n\n3. **Jargon Heavy**\n   - Problem: Using corporate speak that employees can't understand or remember\n   - Solution: Use simple, clear language that anyone can understand\n\n4. **Profit-Focused**\n   - Problem: Confusing mission (why we exist) with business model (how we make money)\n   - Solution: Focus on value creation, not value capture\n\n## Success Patterns\n\n1. **Customer-Centric**\n   - Clear identification of who benefits and how\n   - Specific understanding of customer needs and pain points\n\n2. **Memorable**\n   - Short enough to remember, meaningful enough to inspire\n   - Employees can recite and explain the mission\n\n3. **Distinctive**\n   - Differentiates from competitors and alternatives\n   - Unique perspective on value creation\n\n4. **Actionable**\n   - Provides decision-making guidance for employees\n   - Clear implications for product and service decisions\n\n## Industry Variations\n\n### Software/SaaS\n- Often focuses on enabling customer success or transformation\n- Emphasis on empowering users or solving business problems\n- Technology as means, not end\n\n### Physical Products\n- Usually emphasizes improving daily life or experiences\n- Focus on quality, accessibility, or innovation\n- Tangible impact on customer lives\n\n### Services\n- Typically centers on solving specific problems or challenges\n- Professional expertise as value driver\n- Relationship-based value creation\n\n### Nonprofit\n- Always includes social impact and beneficiary outcomes\n- Clear social change or improvement goal\n- Mission often defines success metrics\n\n## Relationship Guidelines\n\n### Typical Dependencies\n- **None** (Mission is foundational)\n\n### Typical Enablements\n- **VSN (Vision)**: Mission provides foundation for future aspirations\n- **VAL (Values)**: Mission informs behavioral principles\n- **STR (Strategy)**: Mission guides strategic approach\n- **PUR (Purpose)**: Mission may inform broader social purpose\n\n### Common Conflicts\n- **Multiple competing missions** in organization\n- **Mission-strategy misalignment**\n- **Mission-culture gaps**\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Creation Process\n1. **Stakeholder Interviews**: Understand founder/leadership intent\n2. **Beneficiary Analysis**: Identify who truly benefits from organization\n3. **Value Creation Mapping**: Understand unique value provided\n4. **Draft and Iterate**: Create multiple versions and test\n\n### Review Process\n1. **Annual Review**: Assess mission relevance and effectiveness\n2. **Strategic Planning**: Use mission to guide strategic decisions\n3. **Performance Assessment**: Measure progress toward mission fulfillment\n4. **Cultural Integration**: Ensure mission lives in daily operations\n\n### Measurement Approaches\n- **Employee Understanding**: Survey employee ability to explain mission\n- **Decision Alignment**: Track strategic decisions against mission\n- **Stakeholder Recognition**: Measure external understanding of purpose\n- **Value Creation Metrics**: Quantify mission fulfillment\n\n## Document Relationships\n\nThis document type commonly relates to:\n\n- **Enables**: VSN (Vision), VAL (Values), STR (Strategy), PUR (Purpose)\n- **Informs**: All strategic planning documents\n- **Guides**: Product development, hiring, partnership decisions\n- **Measures**: Organization performance and culture health\n\n## Validation Checklist\n\n- [ ] Mission statement is clear and memorable\n- [ ] Primary beneficiaries are specifically identified\n- [ ] Value creation is unique and meaningful\n- [ ] Mission provides decision-making guidance\n- [ ] All stakeholders understand and support mission\n- [ ] Mission differentiates from competitors\n- [ ] Evidence of mission fulfillment exists\n- [ ] Regular review process established"
