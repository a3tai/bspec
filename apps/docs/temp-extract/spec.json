BSpec transforms business documentation from scattered artifacts into **82 standardized document types** organized across **11 business domains**, enabling systematic analysis, automated generation, and intelligent decision-making.\n\n**Key Innovation**: Every business is a system of atomic, interconnected documents that together form a complete picture of strategy, operations, and execution.\n\n## Why BSpec Exists\n\n### The Business Documentation Problem\n\nToday's business documentation is fragmented, inconsistent, and impossible to analyze systematically:\n\n- **Entrepreneurs** reinvent business planning without structured guidance\n- **Investors** compare deals using incompatible formats and incomplete information\n- **AI systems** cannot understand business context to provide intelligent assistance\n- **Organizations** lose knowledge when people leave or contexts change\n\n### The BSpec Solution\n\nBSpec provides a **standardized vocabulary** and **relationship model** for describing any business completely:\n\n```\nBusiness = Graph of Connected Documents\nEach Document = One Business Concern + Rich Metadata\nRelationships = How Documents Depend On, Enable, or Conflict With Each Other\n```\n\nThis enables:\n- **Systematic thinking** through templates and dependencies\n- **Automated analysis** by AI systems that understand business structure\n- **Intelligent generation** of business artifacts (pitch decks, code, marketing)\n- **Consistent evaluation** across different businesses and industries\n\n## Core Principles\n\n### 1. Atomic Documents\nEvery document covers exactly one business concern with clear boundaries.\n\n**Examples**:\n- ❌ **Too Broad**: \"Marketing Strategy\"\n- ✅ **Atomic**: \"Content Marketing Strategy\" + \"Paid Acquisition Channels\" + \"Brand Positioning\"\n\n**Benefits**:\n- **Reusability**: Atomic documents can be recombined for different purposes\n- **Clarity**: Single-concern documents are easier to understand and maintain\n- **Granular Analysis**: AI systems can reason about specific business elements\n- **Change Management**: Updates don't cascade unpredictably\n\n### 2. Rich Relationships\nDocuments explicitly declare their dependencies, what they enable, and what they conflict with.\n\n**Relationship Types**:\n- **Dependencies** (`depends_on`): Prerequisites for this document to be meaningful\n- **Enablements** (`enables`): What this document makes possible\n- **Conflicts** (`conflicts_with`): Mutually exclusive documents\n- **Related** (`related`): Useful context connections\n\n**Example**:\n```yaml\n# PRD-mobile-app-v2.md\ndepends_on: [PER-mobile-user, STR-mobile-first, ARC-mobile-platform]\nenables: [CAM-app-store-launch, REV-premium-features]\nconflicts_with: [STR-web-only-strategy]\n```\n\n### 3. Machine + Human Readability\nDocuments are simultaneously optimized for human understanding and machine processing.\n\n**Structure**:\n```yaml\n---\n# YAML Frontmatter: Machine-readable metadata\nid: STR-platform-strategy\ntype: STR\ndepends_on: [PER-developer, CMP-platform-analysis]\nenables: [REV-platform-revenue, CAM-developer-program]\n---\n\n# Human-readable business narrative\n**Problem**: Need sustainable competitive advantage...\n**Strategy**: Build two-sided platform...\n```\n\n## Document Type Taxonomy\n\nBSpec defines **82 standardized document types** organized across **11 business domains**:\n\n### 1.
