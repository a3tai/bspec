# What is BSpec?

BSpec (Business Specification Standard) is an open-source standard for describing any business as a structured, machine-readable knowledge graph.

## Overview

BSpec provides a universal language that enables:
- **Humans** to document and communicate business strategy, operations, and execution
- **AI systems** to understand, analyze, and reason about businesses
- **Tools** to validate, visualize, and work with business documentation

Think of BSpec as creating a standardized "API" for business knowledge.

## Can MCP enable?

BSpec solves several critical problems in business documentation:

### 1. Lack of Standardization
Every company documents their business differently. BSpec provides 82 standardized document types that cover every aspect of a business, from vision and strategy to operations and execution.

### 2. Disconnected Information
Business documents often exist in silos. BSpec creates rich relationships between documents, forming a knowledge graph that shows how different parts of your business connect.

### 3. AI Integration Challenges
AI agents struggle to understand unstructured business information. BSpec's machine-readable format enables AI systems to parse, analyze, and work with business documentation effectively.

### 4. Inconsistent Coverage
It's hard to know if you've documented everything important. BSpec provides conformance levels (Bronze, Silver, Gold) that guide complete business documentation.

## Why does BSpec matter?

### For Founders and Business Leaders
- **Clarity**: Force clear thinking about every aspect of your business
- **Communication**: Standardized format makes it easier to communicate with investors, team members, and stakeholders
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Enable AI agents to analyze your business, identify gaps, and provide recommendations

### For Investors
- **Due Diligence**: Standardized format makes it easier to evaluate and compare businesses
- **Consistency**: Know what to expect from business documentation
- **Automated Analysis**: Tools can automatically assess business completeness and quality

### For AI Developers
- **Standard Format**: Build tools once that work with any BSpec-compliant business
- **Rich Context**: Relationship model provides deep context for AI reasoning
- **Extensible**: Add custom document types and relationships as needed
