Validation\n*Evidence that journey map accurately reflects customer experience*\n```\n\n## Quality Standards\n\n### Bronze Level (Minimum Viable)\n- [ ] Key journey stages identified and documented\n- [ ] Major touchpoints and pain points captured\n- [ ] Basic emotional journey mapped\n- [ ] All required metadata fields completed\n\n### Silver Level (Investment Ready)\n- [ ] Comprehensive 7-stage journey mapping (Awareness to Advocacy)\n- [ ] Detailed touchpoint analysis with experience quality metrics\n- [ ] Emotional journey arc with pain point impact assessment\n- [ ] Moment of truth
