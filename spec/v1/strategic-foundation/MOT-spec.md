## Common Pitfalls

1. **Operational Advantages**
   - Problem: Confusing operational efficiency with sustainable moats
   - Solution: Focus on advantages that are difficult to replicate

2. **Weak Moats**
   - Problem: Claiming advantages that competitors can easily replicate
   - Solution: Validate moat strength through competitive analysis

3. **Static Thinking**
   - Problem: Assuming current advantages will remain relevant
   - Solution: Monitor moat evolution and develop adaptive strategies

4. **Customer Blindness**
   - Problem: Focusing on advantages that customers don't value
   - Solution: Validate moats through customer research and behavior

## Success Patterns

1. **Network-Enabled**
   - Advantages that strengthen with scale and usage
   - Self-reinforcing value creation

2. **Customer-Validated**
   - Moats that customers actively value and defend
   - Evidence in customer behavior and feedback

3. **Compound Effects**
   - Multiple moats that reinforce each other
   - Synergistic competitive advantages

4. **Evolution-Ready**
   - Advantages that can adapt to changing markets
   - Dynamic moat development capability

## Industry Variations

### Software/SaaS
- Data network effects and learning algorithms
- API ecosystem and integration switching costs
- Platform network effects
- Customer success and stickiness
